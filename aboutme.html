            <h1> The Journey of my life</h1>
            <p>
                                I am writing to you regarding a one year Web Development
                                Course at your institute. I am extremely interested in having the
                                opportunity to join your Institute for a year long boot camp, as my
                                education background and previous work experiences prepares
                                me to further start with the It career. 
                                Over the past five years in Berlin, I have obtained my Bachelor
                                degree in International Business. At the university we were taught
                                many core business concepts but the IT part was very little to
                                negligible. <br> However, the current job market has shifted to mostly
                                online marketing and It related jobs.  Therefore, I was always
                                looking for some sort of depth knowledge which Universities do not
                                seem to offer. Later on, I started learning myself on codecademy
                                and youtube channels. There I explored how much interested I
                                was in coding. In my free time I would always code and try to
                                make websites. So I believe my immense passion towards Web
                                Development, my curiosity of creating new things makes me a 
                                good candidate for the one year Web Development course.<br>
                                Four week orientation course, in my opinion, was a very important
                                step towards giving students the opportunity to explore various
                                aspects of the trending marketing and Web development
                                spectrum. Although I am opting for Web Development, the online
                                marketing classes were very fascinating. I learnt there SEO,SEA,
                                Analytics and so much more, that previously i thought was not so
                                appealing. After the orientation course, I am massively convinced
                                how both courses are interconnected and go head to head
                                together.
                                My motivation for one year course is very simple. I want to become
                                a Web Developer, whereby I can create amazing websites. It
                                makes me happy to see what I have created. This is why I have
                                chosen this career path over some call center jobs or gastronomy
                                jobs.
